# Apogee
## By Peter Lefaivre of Noodle Games

### About:
Apogee is the accidental result of my experiments with procedural generation and physics-based gameplay in Unreal Engine 4. The goal is to create an accessible and mobile-compatible game that adds exploration elements to the traditional infinite scroller genre. I'm only a couple weeks into development, and as such still laying the foundations for the procedural algorithm, mechanics, and aesthetics. So far I've been having tons of fun creating the procedural planet generation algorithm and am super excited to expand upon it's complexity to provide a more interesting exploration-based experience. Apogee comes from a simple root concept, but holds the potential to become a pretty cool game, and that's where I want to take it!

### Controls:
- Boost: Lmb/Space/W
- Brake: Rmb/LCtrl/S
- Pause: P
- Dev Camera Zoom Out: Q
- Dev Camera Zoom In: E

### Roadmap:
A loose list of ideas and concepts in no particular order:
- Random planet colours
  - Two-toned randomization, ie. random land and ocean colours
- Random planet sprites
  - Stars
  - Eliptical/non-spherical planets with craters, etc.
- "Hero" Planets
  - Unique planets that stand out and reward exploring farther from the starting planet
  - Largebois, supernovas, black holes, planets with rings, etc.
- Fuel/energy system
  - Prevent from shooting off in one direction and hoping for the best
  - Refuel/recharge by staying inside a planet's orbit
  - Lose fuel/energy by staying outside a planet's orbit
- Ship Customization
  - Hitting different "planets visited" milestones unlocks new ship sprites
- Actually implementing the info (?) interface
  - Will briefly explain the game's objective and controls
- Optimizing Procedural Generation
  - Right now there's a pretty big buffer zone of unnecessary planets being generated outside of the player's field of vision
- Aesthetic and colour correction improvements
  - Bringing everything together (will come in time)
